		<p>	You work in the terminal to use and control GiT.
			The first task is to point you login to the directory
			you want to work in. GiT must be initilised there first, 
			see page six for detail, but here we are assuming you
			have done this.</p>

		<p>	At your command prompt the key word for a GiT command is
			git. Let's assume your command prompt is something like this:
			<span class='codex'>myself:~$</span> the myself bit will be whatever your username and
			computer name is when you installed the OS.</p>
