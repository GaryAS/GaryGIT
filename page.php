		<h1 class="title"> GiT & GitHub Version Control</h1>
				
			<p>	This is a small demo of the GiT version control system running 
			on a private server using a virtual host environment. It is based on a 
			typical distributed workflow, using GitHub and a single on server 
			GiT controlled repository for the LIVE production environment.</p>

			<br />

			<p>	These pages describe the archituture of this GiT based, distributed
			version control workflow and how it is used. Much of the content is 
			based on the ProGit pages on GitHub authored by SCOTT CHACON.</p>



			<p>Using a working repository on your development laptop, this 
			demo shows how to keep the on server repositories in sync with
			your local system. Branching enables the development of enchancements
			then the testing and sharing of those enhancements before merging
			with the main branch.</p>

			<br />

			<p>This little demo will walk us through the structure, system and use
			of GiT for the development of SeEng.</p>
