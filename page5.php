		<p>WORK IN PROGRESS:</p>

		<p>There are two other processes we need to cover, which don't 
		quite fit into the loop concept. The first is getting you local 
		repository setup in the first place and the second is pushing 
		work up from the Remote Master to the LIVE production 
		environment.</p>

		<h3>Pushing to LIVE</h3>

		<p>	In the sideBar you'll find hints, notes and 
			and further instructions to explain any difficult
			points and things that need highlighting.</p>

		<p>	This site is built using the instructions and
			workflow defined here. You will be able to test
			and work with this site as a sandbox.</p>
				
		<p>	For the reason above the pages have been kept
			very simple, they are just plain html pages, which
			can easily be edited, this will enable people with
			little coding knowledge to actually play with the pages
			and GiT.</p>
