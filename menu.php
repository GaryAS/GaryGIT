			<h4>These Pages</h4>
			<p>The description here is very, very basic, just enough, I
			hope, to get the general principles of GiT, using it and 
			where GitHub fits in established in your head. You will need 
			to refer to the ProGit manual for specific details, in fact 
			I recommend you read chapters one thru three anyway and 
			chapter six is also worth a quick read.<p>

			<a href="index.php">1 - Intro and Basics </a>
			<br /><br />
			<a href="page2.php">2 - Working in Your Local Repository</a>
			<br /><br />
			<a href="page3.php">3 - Branching and Branch Merges</a>
			<br /><br />
			<a href="page4.php">4 - Pushing to Your Remote</a>
			<br /><br />
			<a href="page5.php">5 - Pushing upto the LIVE Repository</a>
			<br /><br />
			<a href="page6.php">6 - Cloning down from GitHub  </a>
